# In-Memory File System

## Introduction

This project implements an in-memory file system in Node.js. The file system supports basic operations such as creating directories, navigating the file system, creating, reading, moving, copying, and deleting files, and listing directory contents. It also supports saving the current state of the file system to a file and loading it back, allowing persistence between sessions.

## Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
in-memory-file-system/
│
├── src/
│   ├── File.js              # Defines the File class
│   ├── Directory.js         # Defines the Directory class
│   ├── FileSystem.js        # Implements the FileSystem class, which manages the entire file system
│   ├── cli.js               # Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the file system
│
├── tests/
│   ├── fileSystem.test.js   # Tests the FileSystem class
│
├── .gitignore               # Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git
├── README.md                # This document
├── jest.config.js           # Configures Jest for testing
├── package.json             # Defines the project dependencies and scripts
└── package-lock.json        # Automatically generated file that describes the exact tree that was generated by npm
```


## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anand008186/in-memory-file-system.git
   cd in-memory-file-system
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the CLI

To start the command-line interface:
```sh
npm start
```

You can interact with the file system using various commands, such as `mkdir`, `cd`, `ls`, `cat`, `touch`, `echo`, `mv`, `cp`, and `rm`.

### Save and Load State Functionality

You can save the current state of the file system to a file and load it back later.

#### Saving the State

To save the current state of the file system, use the `exit` command with the `save_state` option:
```sh
npm start -- '{"save_state": "true", "path": "path/to/save/state.json"}'
```

#### Loading the State

To load the state of the file system from a file, use the `load_state` option:
```sh
npm start -- '{"load_state": "true", "path": "path/to/save/state.json"}'
```

### Example Commands

Here are some example commands you can use to interact with the file system:

```sh
> mkdir /dir1
> cd /dir1
> touch file1.txt
> echo "Hello, World!" /dir1/file1.txt
> ls /dir1
file1.txt
> cat /dir1/file1.txt
Hello, World!
> cd ..
> ls
dir1
> mv /dir1/file1.txt /file1.txt
> ls /dir1
> ls
dir1
file1.txt
```

## Testing Save and Load State Functionality

1. Start the file system and create some directories and files:
   ```sh
   npm start
   > mkdir /dir1
   > touch /dir1/file1.txt
   > echo "Hello, World!" /dir1/file1.txt
   ```

2. Save the state:
   ```sh
   npm start -- '{"save_state": "true", "path": "state.json"}'
   ```

3. Load the state:
   ```sh
   npm start -- '{"load_state": "true", "path": "state.json"}'
   ```

4. Verify that the state is loaded correctly:
   ```sh
   > ls /dir1
   file1.txt
   > cat /dir1/file1.txt
   Hello, World!
   ```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:
```sh
npm test
```

This will execute the unit tests using Jest.

## Conclusion

This in-memory file system provides a simple way to interact with a file system-like structure entirely in memory. It supports basic file operations and can persist its state to disk, allowing you to save your work and resume later.
