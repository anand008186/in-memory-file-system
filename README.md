# In-Memory File System

## Introduction

This project implements an in-memory file system in Node.js. The file system supports basic operations such as creating directories, navigating the file system, creating, reading, moving, copying, and deleting files, and listing directory contents. It also supports saving the current state of the file system to a file and loading it back, allowing persistence between sessions.

## Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the file system.
  - `File.js`: Defines the `File` class.
  - `Directory.js`: Defines the `Directory` class.
  - `FileSystem.js`: Implements the `FileSystem` class, which manages the entire file system.
  - `cli.js`: Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the file system.
- `tests/`: Contains the unit tests for the file system.
  - `fileSystem.test.js`: Tests the `FileSystem` class.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: This document.
- `jest.config.js`: Configures Jest for testing.
- `package.json`: Defines the project dependencies and scripts.
- `package-lock.json`: Automatically generated file that describes the exact tree that was generated by npm.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 18.x)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anand008186/in-memory-file-system.git
   cd in-memory-file-system
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the CLI

To start the command-line interface:
```sh
npm start
```

You can interact with the file system using various commands, such as `mkdir`, `cd`, `ls`, `cat`, `touch`, `echo`, `mv`, `cp`, and `rm`.

### Save and Load State Functionality

You can save the current state of the file system to a file and load it back later.

1. Save the state:
   ```sh
   npm start -- '{"save_state": "true", "path": "state.json"}'
   ```

2. Load the state:
   ```sh
   npm start -- '{"load_state": "true", "path": "state.json"}'
   ```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:
```sh
npm test
```

This will execute the unit tests using Jest.

## Conclusion

This in-memory file system provides a simple way to interact with a file system-like structure entirely in memory. It supports basic file operations and can persist its state to disk, allowing you to save your work and resume later.
